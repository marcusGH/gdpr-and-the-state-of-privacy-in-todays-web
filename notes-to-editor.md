# Notes to the Editor

## Relevant style guidelines

The proposed infographic is designed for print, so I need to use the Lato font
with sizes 12, 8.5 and 8.5 for the title, axis titles and axis labels,
respectively. Additionally, the sources and notes should be font size 8, with
the direct labels on the "GDPR violations" plot being of size 9.5. For this
plot, I was also tempted to make it a map, but the style guide discouraged this
unless it revealed a geographic pattern, which it did not.  Additionally, the
"websites of the internet" plot shows four groups, so I should use the
categorical colour palettes suggested by the style-guide. For the 


## Guidelines That Were Met and Not Met

All the guidelines related to the font choice, sizes of text and colours on the
chart, as well as their alignment, were met.

* Full-width graphics
* Figure number
* All text horizontal
* Avoiding vertical grid lines in bar charts?

Charts are full-width, corresponding to 6.5" or 16.51cm, but I think that could better use the available 20x24cm space available by splitting the inforgraphic into two columns and having a narrower chart in each column.

Did not include figure number and Urban Institute tagline, because designed for print and figures
not referenced. Additionally, published in a new magazine, not on Urban Institute's websites.

For the bar chart, could not avoid vertical grid lines. Would be possible to
add another bard for EU sites, non EU sites and overall average, but would be
misleading as these would not be Countries, and would also not necessarily be
GDPR violations because they do not all contain EU-based websites

## Possible Alterations

More funding, allow more data exploration of HTTP Archive's tables, also look at temporal aspect
by repeating the query for different years, before and after GDPR became enforceable.

Would ask for help with better portraying the EU, non-EU and overall average of
the "GDPR violations" plot, without using vertical text and vertical grid
lines.

Additionally, ask for help on making plotting and infographic compilation more portable, as
currently requires a lot of difference system packages, such as `inkscape`, `latexmk`
